Some problems may be out of your control, while others may be easy to rectify. This post aims to list a few of them, and also how to eliminate or lessen their impact.</p><h1 id=language-barrier>Language Barrier</h1><p>Not being able to speak the language of another party inhibits your ability to communicate effectively. Hiring an interpreter or using translation software are two ways to get around the problem, as well as simply learning relevant phrases from the other language. A problem with using an interpreter, is that that one may not be available, or it may be excessively costly.</p><h1 id=auditory-impairment>Auditory Impairment</h1><p>To assist those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, you may consider hiring a sign language interpreter. Providing a textual version of presentations or wearing a hearing-aid microphone are other options. A textual version may not be preferable (or possible) for a more informal, unscripted presentation or meeting. As with foreign language interpreters, one may not be available in the appropriate timeframe or within an appropriate budget.</p><h1 id=lack-of-structure--organisation>Lack of Structure & Organisation</h1><p>An unstructured document or presentation that contains a lot of tangential, unrelated information, will be difficult to follow.
Lacking organisation, for example showing up late or hastily preparing your work in front of a crowd, will undermine what you had planned to say and should be avoided. You should get presentations or documents ready in advance.</p><h1 id=technological-failures>Technological Failures</h1><p>An example of a technological failure is a projector not working. You could mitigate this by preparing a printed version of slides.</p><h1 id=incoherence--unclear-speaking>Incoherence & Unclear Speaking</h1><p>Being unclear when speaking—having a stutter, lisp or mumble—will hamper people’s ability to understand what you are saying. Speaking clearly and confidently whenever possible will avoid this barrier.</p><h1 id=learning-difficulties>Learning Difficulties</h1><p>A learning difficulty inhibits one’s ability to understand and learn new information. You may consider using simpler terminology and repetition to make the content easier to understand and be retained.</p><h1 id=lack-of-understanding-or-knowledge>Lack of Understanding or Knowledge</h1><p>If the audience does not understand the information you are giving, this will inhibit its effectiveness. You should use appropriate terminology when possible, however this should be adjusted based on the knowledge and skillset of who you are speaking to. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to predict how much the audience already knows, and this may need to be done on-the-fly. You could mitigate this by defaulting to simpler words, however this may come across as patronising to a knowledgeable audience.</p><h1 id=background-noise>Background Noise</h1><p>Background noise, such as air conditioners or chatter, may make it harder for the audience to understand what you are saying. It may not always be possible to remove certain forms of background noise, in this case you may consider a quieter setting if they are a major barrier.</p><h1 id=distractions>Distractions</h1><p>A distraction, such as a phone call or someone walking into the room, will cause your audience to become disengaged from the content you are delivering. Mitigating this can be achieved by switching one’s phone to silent and displaying clear signage at entrances that a conference or meeting is taking place. This may not always be possible, for example someone may disrupt the event by arriving late.</p><h1 id=lack-of-enthusiasm--poor-presenting>Lack of Enthusiasm & Poor Presenting</h1><p>Not being interested or enthused in what you are saying will rub off on the audience; be it in a casual conversation or a major meeting. You should aim to appear lively and interesting to retain the audience’s engagement. Appropriate body language, such as eye contact, will aid with this.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Thomas Robinson</footer></body></html>
